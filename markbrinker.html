                <p>Confused by website terminology?</p>
                <p>If so, here’s a handy glossary (all in plain English) that’ll quickly get you up to speed and demystify the language of web technology.</p>
                <p>Once you understand basic website jargon, you’ll never get intimidated or befuddled the next time a web designer or web developer spews techno-babble.</p>

                <h1>Basic Anatomy Of A Website</h1>
                <p>Let’s start by defining the various parts of a website:</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>Header</h2>
                <p>The header is the top section of a website, where you’ll usually find the logo and the site’s navigation menu. It’s that steady, reliable part of the page that stays visible no matter where visitors click on your site.</p>
                <p>Years ago, headers often featured big banners or graphics to promote a brand—similar to the cover photo on a Facebook page. But these days, the trend is to keep things simple, with just a logo, navigation, and possibly a call-to-action button to keep your website looking clean and modern.</p>
            </article>

        <section>
            <article>
                <h2>Pre-Header</h2>
                <p>The pre-header is the thin strip that sits above the main header. It’s often used to display helpful information like your contact details, business hours, special offers, or even secondary navigation links. Think of it as a small but mighty space for quick-access details that your visitors might appreciate seeing right away.</p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section>
            <article>
                <h2>Favicon</h2>
                <p>A favicon is the small icon that appears in a browser tab next to your website title. It’s usually a simplified version of your logo or brand mark. Favicons help visitors quickly identify your website when they have multiple tabs open, and they add a polished, professional look to your site.</p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section>
            <article>
                <h2>Navigation (aka Navigation Bar or Main Menu)</h2>
                <p>The navigation is the set of links at the top of a website that helps visitors find what they’re looking for. These links are usually part of the header or located just below it.</p>
                <p>On mobile devices, navigation links often transform into an icon with three stacked lines—commonly called a “hamburger” menu because it resembles a side view of a hamburger. Tapping this icon reveals a vertical toggle or horizontal flyout menu, making it easy to browse even on smaller screens.</p>
                <p>For more complex websites with tons of pages, you might encounter a “mega menu.” This is a dropdown menu that appears when you hover over or click a link in the main navigation. It displays multiple categories and subcategories, neatly organizing many links—kind of like a visual sitemap.</p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section>
            <article>
                <h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
                <p>Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation that shows visitors their location within a website’s hierarchy. They usually appear near the top of the page and look something like this:</p>
                <p><i>Home > Blog > Latest Posts > Post Title</i></p>
                <p>Breadcrumbs make it easy for visitors to understand where they are on your site and quickly backtrack to previous pages. They’re especially helpful for larger websites with lots of categories and subpages.</p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section>
            <article>
                <h2>Website Content</h2>
                <p>When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website content goes beyond just words. </p>
                <p>Website content is <b>everything</b> on your site that communicates your message to visitors. It includes all the elements people interact with—text, images, videos, audio, and more. It’s the full collection of materials designed to inform, engage, or persuade your audience—the whole package, or as some might say, the whole shebang.</p>
            </article>

        <section>
            <article>
                <h2>Homepage (or home page)</h2>
                <p>The <a href="">homepage</a> — also called the front page or main page — is the starting point of most websites. It’s often the first page visitors see and serves as a central hub to guide them through your site.</p>
                <p>The homepage sets the tone for the entire website, giving visitors a quick sense of who you are, what you do, and where they should go next. It’s like the front door to your business online.</p>
                <p>Common elements on a home page include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A hero area (headline and image) to grab attention.</li>
                    <li>A navigation menu to help visitors find key pages.</li>
                    <li>Links or sections highlighting your most important content, services, or calls to action.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A common website design best practice is to link your logo to the home page. This gives visitors an easy “escape” or “reset” if they ever get lost while navigating your site.</p>

                <h1>Additional Terminology Of Modern Websites</h1>
                <h2>WordPress</h2>
                <p>WordPress powers <a href="">millions of websites</a> worldwide and is one of the most popular tools for building and managing websites.</p>
                <p>Think of WordPress as the operating system for your website—similar to how Windows runs on a PC, macOS on a MacBook, or iOS on an iPhone. It’s a content management system (CMS) that allows you to easily add, remove, or update content without needing advanced technical skills.</p>
                <p>Here's how WordPress works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Themes</b>: A WordPress theme controls how your site looks. It’s what transforms WordPress into a functional website. There are thousands of themes—some free, some paid—and most can be customized to match your company’s brand. Using a theme is far faster (and cheaper) than building a website entirely from scratch, like we had to do back in the early 2000s.</li>
                    <li><b>Plugins</b>: Plugins add functionality to your site, much like apps on your phone. With tens of thousands of WordPress plugins available, you can add features like contact forms, image galleries, site security, shopping carts—pretty much anything you can imagine.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thanks to themes and plugins, WordPress makes it possible to build a custom, high-quality website for a fraction of what it used to cost.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>WordPress Page vs. WordPress Post</h2>
                <p>This takes a bit of explaining, so I wrote a whole piece on the similarities and differences between WordPress pages and posts, which you can find <a href="">here</a>.</p>
            </article>

        <section>
            <article>
                <h2>Hosting</h2>
                <p>To have a website on the internet, it needs to be <b>hosted</b> on a web server. Think of hosting as the piece of land where your website “lives.” Just like you need land to build a house, you need a server to store your website’s files and make them available to people on the internet.</p>
                <p>There are plenty of companies that offer website hosting services, like <a href="">HostGator</a> or <a href="">BlueHost</a> which rent out space on their servers so your site can be available online 24/7.</p>

        <section>
            <article>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>I hope you found this mini crash course on website terminology helpful.</p>
                <p>The good news? You don’t need to understand all the tech behind the scenes to have productive conversations with a web designer or developer. A basic grasp of these terms is more than enough to help you feel confident and informed.</p>
                <p>I’ll be updating this glossary over time, so if there’s a term I missed or one you think should be added, let me know in the comments below. Thanks for reading! </p>
