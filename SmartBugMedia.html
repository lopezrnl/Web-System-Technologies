            <p>In your home, chances are there are several points people could enter your house from—front doors, back doors, garage doors, windows, and so on—however, your guests probably enter your home from one point more times than all of the others combined.</p>

            <p>That’s how the homepage of your website works, as well—there are several entry points and pages on your website, but more times than not, <a href="">users find your homepage first.</a></p>

            <p>That’s why on a typical website, the homepage has the most traffic and links pointing to it. That’s because your homepage is the oldest URL on your website, your homepage typically has the most direct visits, and homepages are the most advertised URL for online and offline marketing channels.</p>

            <p>In this blog post, we'll dive a little deeper on how (and why) to keep your homepage updated and optimized.</p>

            <h1>Before Your Start Designing, Remember...</h1>
            <p>Clearly define goals and strategies for what you want your homepage to accomplish for your company first. These goals could include defining what your website is about and what you want the action step to be for users that visit your homepage.
            <p>Smartbug is a platform that connects users with smart solutions for everyday problems.</p>
