            <p>The details are not the details. They make the design,‚Äù Charles Eames once said, and that has never stopped to be true. Starting to design a web page, we have to consider what it should consist of to solve the task set for it and be both usable and beautiful. Our today‚Äôs article is devoted right to those vital details that create an effective web page. Let‚Äôs briefly review what elements can be essential for a typical <a href="">web page,</a> what impact each element has, and how it contributes to the general user experience. Packed with plenty of web design examples.</p>
        </section>

            <h1>Header</h1>
            <p>Header is the upper (top) part of the webpage. Being the area people see before scrolling the page in their first seconds on the website, the header is an element of strategic importance. It is expected from the header to provide the core navigation around the website so that users could scan it in split seconds and jump to the main pages that can help them. Headers are also referred to as site menus and positioned as an element of primary navigation in the website layout.</p>
            <p>Headers may include a bunch of meaningful layout elements, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>basic elements of <a href=""><b>brand identity,</b></a> usually a logo</li>
                <li>call-to-action button</li>
                <li>links to basic categories of website content</li>
                <li>links to the social networks</li>
                <li>basic contact information (telephone number, e-mail address, etc.)</li>
                <li>switcher of the languages in case of the multilingual interface</li>
                <li><a href=""><b>search field</b></a></li>
                <li>subscription field or button</li>
                <li>links to interaction with the product such as trial version, downloading from the AppStore, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It doesn‚Äôt mean that all the mentioned elements should be included in one web page header: in this case, the header section would be overloaded with information. The more objects attract the user‚Äôs attention, the harder it is to concentrate on the vital ones. On the basis of design tasks, designers, sometimes together with marketing specialists, decide on the strategically important options and pick them up from the list or add the others.</p>
            <p>What makes a header a vital element contributing to web usability is the fact that it is placed in the most scannable zone of a web page. Whatever is the <a href=""><b>scanning pattern</b></a> users stick to on a website, it starts from the top part of the page, scanned from left to right for languages using the same reading and writing pattern. It means that what is placed in the header won‚Äôt be missed, especially the elements placed in its left and right corners. That‚Äôs why you will often find the main CTA button in one of them. What‚Äôs more, the power of habit and the idea of <a href=""><b>external consistency</b></a> of user experience should also be taken into account here. For years so far, visitors have been used to finding core navigation in headers, so mostly, the main question is to decide what to put into it rather than to use a header or not.</p>
            <p>Some of the popular design practices for web headers include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>hamburger menu:</b> hiding the set of links to different pages or sections behind the <a href=""><b>hamburger button</b></a> called so as it consists of horizontal lines looking like a typical bread-meat-bread hamburger.</li>
                <li><b>sticky header:</b> header that doesn‚Äôt hide away but sticks to the top part of the page when users are scrolling the page down. This way core navigation area is available at any point of interaction, which can be helpful in terms of content-heavy pages with long scrolling.</li>
                <li><b>two-layer navigation:</b> a sort of double set of navigation sites in the header to separate two different routes of navigation that are both important for web usability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One more widely-used pattern for website headers is making a logo clickable and opening or refreshing the home page after it‚Äôs clicked.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>CTA Button</h1>
            <p>A <a href=""><b>call-to-action (CTA) button</b></a> is an element of a user interface aimed at encouraging a user to take a certain action. This action presents a conversion for a particular page or screen (for example, buy, contact, subscribe, etc.). In other words, it turns a passive user into an active one. So, technically it can be any type of button that is supported with a call-to-action text. This type of button differs from all the other buttons on the page or screen due to its engaging nature: it has to catch attention and stimulate users to do the required action.</p>
            <p>Effective call-to-action buttons are easy to notice; designers intentionally create them so that website visitors could see them in split seconds and respond. That‚Äôs why they are usually bold buttons containing microcopy with a particular call to action (e.g., ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuy it now‚Äù), which explains the main action for this page and encourages a user to do it. If CTA buttons are not clearly defined and don‚Äôt attract attention, visitors are likely to scan the content quickly and leave it untouched.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Hero Section</h1>
            <p>Hero section is the above-the-fold (pre-scroll area of the web page containing the element that presents the strong visual hook: a <a href=""><b>hero image,</b></a> slider, catchy piece of typography, video, or anything else attracting visitors‚Äô attention and transfers a needed message to them. Make no mistake, the term doesn‚Äôt require that all images of this kind should include a human, animal, mascot, or any other kind of character. Don‚Äôt get tricked over with that ‚Äúhero‚Äù part. It can also be the product photo or the theme image featuring a landscape, a device, a building ‚Äì anything, even an abstract model or composition. The main idea is that the visual hook in the hero section instantly grabs attention and allows for setting the quick visual, emotional, and informative connection with the users, engaging them to scroll or push the buttons to learn more.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Footer</h1>
            <p>Footer is the lower (bottom) part of the web page which usually marks its end. Being another common zone of global website navigation, the footer provides the additional field for useful links and data users may be interested in finding.</p>
            <p>Footers can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>brand identity signs, usually the name and logo of the company or product</li>
                <li>links to user support sections, for example, FAQ page, About page, Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, Support Team, etc.</li>
                <li>credits to website creators</li>
                <li>contact forms and information</li>
                <li>links to company or product accounts in social networks</li>
                <li>testimonials and badges</li>
                <li>certification signs</li>
                <li>subscription field or button</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As well as the header, the footer is not the element found in all websites users can come across the web. For instance, when infinite scrolling is applied, the traditional footer is not an effective navigation zone. However, in the case of infinite scrolling, the idea of a fixed footer can also be applicable and support navigation not losing this area. For most users, the footer is a common place to search for contact information, credits, and sitemaps, so playing on this pattern can be beneficial. The decision on using a footer is always based on the idea of supporting general usability and navigability. Anyway, if the footer is applied, it should get in harmonic combination with all the other design solutions of the website layout and general stylistic concept.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>Slider</h1>
            <p>Slider is an interactive element that applies a technique of a slideshow or carousel to present different products, offers, etc. It is especially popular as a part of <a href=""><b>e-commerce</b></a> and business websites to present a sort of gallery of products or services.</p>
            <p>Sliders present controversial interactive elements that often become an object of hot debates. Among the benefits, we could mention the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>saving space on the page</li>
                <li>user engagement</li>
                <li>attractive visual hook</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, sliders also have some downsides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>page speed decreasing due to slider functionality, this way influencing SEO</li>
                <li>display of several equal options together, which may hurt usability and get distracting as people do not observe priorities, and that makes it harder to focus</li>
                <li>possible problems of sliders in the mobile adaptation of the website</li>
                <li>as well as banners, sliders can be perceived as ads and skipped</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, deciding upon slider integration into the web layout, designers must consider all pros and cons for each particular case.</p>
